        Have you got colour in your cheeks?
        Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
        That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
        Are there some aces up your sleeve?
        Have you no idea that you're in deep?
        I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
        How many secrets can you keep?
        'Cause there's this tune I found
        That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
        Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
        (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
        (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
        (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
        For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

        Standing here
        And staring at you
        I can't leave this place
        I'm stuck in this room
        You're standing there
        Feets on the floor
        I hope you won't be blown
        Out of the window
        Got me fever
        Owe you plenty
        Now I'm holding on
        Got me fever now I'm ready
        Take me to the storm
        Got me fever
