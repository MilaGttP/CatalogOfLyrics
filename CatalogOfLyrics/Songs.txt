        Is there anybody in there?
 	Just nod if you can hear me
	Is there anyone home?
 	Come on now
 	I hear you're feeling down
	Well I can ease your pain
 	Get you on your feet again
 	Relax
	I'll need some information first
 	Just the basic facts
 	Can you show me where it hurts?

     Текст: 
        We passed upon the stair
 	We spoke of was and when
	Although I wasn't there
 	He said I was his friend
	Which came as a surprise
 	I spoke into his eyes
	I thought you died alone
 	A long long time ago

     Текст: 
        Breathe, breathe in the air
 	Don't be afraid to care
	Leave, don't leave me
 	Walk around and choose your own ground
	Long you live and high you fly
 	Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
	All you touch and all you see
 	Is all your life will ever be
